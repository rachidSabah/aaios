"""Event contracts — the typed envelope that flows on the Event Bus.

Events are the only mechanism by which components communicate state changes.
Every event has:
  - A unique id (UUID).
  - A monotonic sequence number per stream.
  - A timestamp (UTC).
  - A correlation_id (the task that caused this event).
  - A causation_id (the event that triggered this event, if any).
  - A topic (string, dot-separated, e.g. ``agent.dispatched``).
  - A payload (Pydantic-validated against the topic's schema).
  - An actor (who emitted this event).

INV-04: every event is persisted to the event store BEFORE any subscriber is
allowed to observe a side effect.
